# CIRCA_CHEM_PU

The folder contains the scripts and data needed to reproduce the analysis described in the manuscript: A time differentiated dietary intervention effect on the biomarkers of exposure to pyrethroids and neonicotinoids pesticides

RMD files:

1. part_1_descriptives: demographics, compliance, FFQ and 24DHR data; data preprocessing and relevant comparative statistical analysis for the anthropometrics 
2. part_2_descriptives_models: biomarker analysis, data preprocessing and mixed effect models (including sensitivity analysis - only subjects who were compliant in both treatment periods (n=33)).
3. part_3_metabolomics: metabolomics preprocessing and models.
